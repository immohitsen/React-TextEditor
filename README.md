# ScriptHub

## Introduction

ScriptHub is a versatile text editor built using React. It is designed to be user-friendly and is perfect for writing blogs or other text-based content. This is my first React project, and I plan to commit new updates frequently over the next month.

## Features

- Rich text editing
- Blog writing capabilities
- Regular updates and improvements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/immohitsen/ScriptHub.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ScriptHub
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

To start the app in development mode, run:
```bash
npm start
```
Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### Running Tests

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, run:
```bash
npm test
```

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized build in the `build` folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. The app is ready to be deployed!

### Ejecting

If you need to customize the configuration, you can eject the app:
```bash
npm run eject
```
**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!
